# ======================================= #

# This config contains all the data relating to a track.
# There are a bunch of settings here for maximum
# flexibility. But only mess around with the things you
# need to or you might just break something!

# Here's something rather simple. The TrackName. Choose
# something cool, but don't make it too long. Example
# names: Dry Dry Ruins, Moo-Moo's Farm, Rocky Mountain.
# Choose wisely!

TrackName: 'My Track'

# NMS stands for "Net.Minecraft.Server." NMS code is
# great for developers because it lets us do things
# that you can't just do with the Bukkit API, such
# as modifying specific mob attriubutes. The only
# way to modify the Horse's speed (other than with
# a speed potion is through NMS. There is a catch
# however. NMS can usually break with EVERY Minecraft
# update. :( If you don't care about the horse's
# speeds, you can go ahead and leave this disabled.

NMS:
  Enabled: true
  MaxHorseSpeed: 0.225

# You can set the raceline ingame with the /ed line1
# and /ed line2 commands. But if you'd like to do
# some extra tweaking, go ahead and modify these
# fields. The X, Y, and Z fields can all be decimals.

# The "NoJumpRange" setting is how far away the player
# must be to NOT be able to jump. There is an exploit
# that lets some players jump with their horse and
# walk through the raceline (ono). While it is found
# that if the player tries to abuse this and get laps
# he will simply be forced out again, this is still a
# gray area. Better safe than sorry, but the higehr
# the no-jump range, the more lag you may find.

  NoJumpRange: 10

# At the start of the race, a firework will, well, fire
# up to the sky. This can be set with /ed spawn flarespawn
# by default.
